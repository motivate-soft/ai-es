## RememberSelectionLayers

Moves objects to their original layers. The information must be saved. The objects are moved to the top of the layer.

## RenameLayerAsText

Renames layers by name, if any, or by the contents of the text object in the layer. The source is optionally the first top or bottom text in the layer.

## SortLayerItems

Sorts objects alphabetically inside layers. The sublayers are sorted with the objects and when you select `Include all sublayers` their contents too. The layer count is automatically updated. Objects without a name (in pointy brackets `<Group>`, `<Ellipse>`, etc.) are placed top / bottom.
